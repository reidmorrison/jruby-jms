# Module: Java Messaging System (JMS) Interface
module JMS
  # Every JMS session must have at least one Connection instance
  # A Connection instance represents a connection between this client application
  # and the JMS Provider (server/queue manager/broker).
  # A connection is distinct from a Session, in that multiple Sessions can share a
  # single connection. Also, unit of work control (commit/rollback) is performed
  # at the Session level.
  #
  # Since many JRuby applications will only have one connection and one session
  # several convenience methods have been added to support creating both the
  # Session and Connection objects automatically.
  #
  # For Example, to read all messages from a queue and then terminate:
  #  require 'rubygems'
  #  require 'jms'
  #
  #  JMS::Connection.create_session(
  #    :factory => 'org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory',
  #    :broker_url => 'tcp://localhost:61616',
  #    :require_jars => [
  #      '~/Applications/apache-activemq-5.5.0/activemq-all-5.5.0.jar',
  #      '~/Applications/apache-activemq-5.5.0/lib/optional/slf4j-log4j12-1.5.11.jar',
  #      '~/Applications/apache-activemq-5.5.0/lib/optional/log4j-1.2.14.jar',
  #    ]
  #  ) do |session|
  #    session.consumer(:queue_name=>'TEST') do |consumer|
  #      if message = consumer.receive_no_wait
  #        puts "Data Received: #{message.data}"
  #      else
  #        puts 'No message available'
  #      end
  #    end
  #  end
  #
  # The above code creates a Connection and then a Session. Once the block completes
  # the session is closed and the Connection disconnected.
  #
  # See: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/jms/Connection.html

    #
    # In JMS we need to start by obtaining the JMS Factory class that is supplied
    # by the JMS Vendor.
    #
    # There are 3 ways to establish a connection to a JMS Provider
    #   1. Supply the name of the JMS Providers Factory Class
    #   2. Supply an instance of the JMS Provider class itself
    #   3. Use a JNDI lookup to return the JMS Provider Factory class
    # Parameters:
    #   :factory   => String: Name of JMS Provider Factory class
    #              => Class: JMS Provider Factory class itself
    #
    #   :jndi_name    => String: Name of JNDI entry at which the Factory can be found
    #   :jndi_context => Mandatory if jndi lookup is being used, contains details
    #                    on how to connect to JNDI server etc.
    #
    #   :require_jars => An optional array of Jar file names to load for the specified
    #                    JMS provider. By using this option it is not necessary
    #                    to put all the JMS Provider specific jar files into the
    #                    environment variable CLASSPATH prior to starting JRuby
    #
    #   :username  => Username to connect to JMS provider with
    #   :password  => Password to use when to connecting to the JMS provider
    #                 Note: :password is ignored if :username is not supplied
    #
    # :factory and :jndi_name are mutually exclusive, both cannot be supplied at the
    # same time. :factory takes precedence over :jndi_name
    #
    # JMS Provider specific properties can be set if the JMS Factory itself
    # has setters for those properties.
